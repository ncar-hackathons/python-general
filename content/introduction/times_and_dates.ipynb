    "# Times and Dates\n",
    "Time is an essential component of nearly all geoscience data. Timescales span orders of magnitude from microseconds for lightning, hours for a supercell thunderstorm, days for a global weather model, millenia and beyond for the earth's climate. To properly analyze geoscience data, you must have a firm understanding of how to handle time in Python. In this notebook, we will examine the Python Standard Library for handling dates and times. We will also briefly make use of the [pytz](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytz) module to handle some thorny time zone issues in Python.\n",

(The full description of the data are [described here](https://ghrc.nsstc.nasa.gov/uso/ds_docs/vaiconus/vaiconus_dataset.html#a6).) In order to parse this string or others that follow the same format, you will employ the [datetime.strptime()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime) method from the `datetime` module. This method takes two arguments: the first is the date time string you wish to parse, the second is the format which describes exactly how the date and time are arranged. [The full range of format options is described in the Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior). In reality, the format will take some degree of experimentation to get right. This is a situation where Python shines as you can quickly try out different solutions in the IPython interpreter. Beyond the official documentation, Google and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) are your friends in this process. Eventually, after some trial and error, you will find the <code>'%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S.%f'</code> format will properly parse the date and time."
