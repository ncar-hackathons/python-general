# Python Guide for People in a Hurry

This is a quick guide to the Python Language. To Learn Python from scratch, we suggest you start with Think Python: [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf) by Allen Downey.

If you already know other programming languages and just want to learn the specifics of Python, this tutorial is for you. We are going to cover a lot of ground at a pretty fast pace.
