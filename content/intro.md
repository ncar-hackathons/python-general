# Why Python?

- Python is a **high-productivity** language. That means, it's designed (from the ground up) to do a lot with very little typing/code. Python syntax is simple, avoiding strange symbols or lengthy routine specifications that would divert the reader from mathematical or scientific understanding of the code.

- Python is **interpretted**, like IDL or Matlab, so you don't need to compile your code for it to run. You just need python on your system. That also makes Python portable!


- Python has a **"batteries included"** philosophy. There is a rich collection of already existing bricks of classic numerical methods, plotting or data processing tools in Python ecosystem. We don’t want to re-program the plotting of a curve, a Fourier transform or a fitting algorithm. Don’t reinvent the wheel!

- Python ecosystem provides Python numerical modules that are **computationally efficient**. But needless to say that very fast code becomes useless if too much time is spent writing it. Python aims for quick development times and quick execution times.
